# Project management
The goal of project management is to make it easier to understand the work that needs to be done, track the progress of individual work items, to reduce the communications overhead, and to increase productivity of all involved.
By applying project management strategies to your work you can expect to get more work done with your limited resources, have a clearer view of the current state of your projects, and be able to collaborate with others more effectively.

## Project management basics
The two main project management styles that are applied in software development, business, and research are waterfall and agile.
The two styles represent different ends of a flexibility spectrum.

In the **waterfall** mindset there is a very linear approach to the design and execution and delivery of the project with the main focus being on compliance and following a set process.
This works well in situations that are very risk averse, or have a large amount of external oversight.
You'll see waterfall style project management in large projects like instrument development, construction, and commissioning. 

Due to the rigid design of waterfall managed projects, the work requirements are often visualised in a Gantt chart such as the one below:

| :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| The waterfall management style gets it's name from the fact that work items are completed in a linear fashion with a cascading dependency chart such as that above. |

With a **agile** mindset the main focus is on outcomes and deliverables, with the design and execution and delivery occurring in cycles.
An agile approach works well in situations where the path to completion is not well defined, or where resources or requirements are liable to change throughout the project.
Without knowing it you will probably already be engaged in a very agile-like approach to your research projects simply because so much of your work is likely to be exploratory in nature.

| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| In a research context, an agile approach is all about exploring and responding to change (discoveries). You don't know the outcome of your work before you start. |


A common tool for visualizing and tracking work, particularly in an agile process, is the kanban board.
The Kanban board was initially as a physical pin board on which cards or sticky notes were used to represent tasks.
The tasks are organized into columns based on their status, and would typically migrate left to right across the board.
Columns are customized for each project, but there are typically no more than 4-5.
If a board is tracking multiple projects, or a project has multiple deliverables, then the board can also be divided horizontally into swimlanes.
As the name suggests, tasks can move within a swimlanes, but are not intended to change lanes.

> ## Design a board
> Think of a project that you are currently working on and design a Kanban board for it.
> Consider the following:
> - How many task status categories are needed and what do you label them.
> - Could you get away with fewer categories?
> - Would it be useful to divide your tasks into different swimlanes, and if so how?
> - What tasks could you put in each category right now?
> 
> Using a simple markdown format create a table in our shared document that shows the categories (and swimlanes if used) that you would use for your project.
> If you have time include some example tasks.
> (See the example table).

Cards have a lot of features that you can play with.
Some of the immediately useful ones include:
- a due date
- embedded check lists for incremental tasks
- customizable coloured labels
- attachments
- The ability to use markdown to format the text of the card
- A chat/discussion space

### Online Kanban with Trello
Trello is one of the most popular project management applications thanks to it being easy to use, flexible, and free.

If you have not already, create a Trello account [here](https://trello.com/).

Trello organizes your tasks by workspaces and boards.
Tasks that relate to a project are grouped into the same boards, and then multiple related boards are grouped into a workspace.
For example you may have a different board for each of your research projects, but then group them together based on your collaborations.
If you are doing a PhD then you’ll probably just need a single board for your PhD, and a single workspace to hold that board.
As an early career researcher you’ll probably have a workspace that is something like "my astro work", which then has a different board for each of the projects that you are involved in.
Many people find it useful to also have a "personal" or "home life" board that they use to track non-work related activities.
These are good people.

Trello uses a Kanban board to track tasks for each of your boards, and this is the default visualization that you’ll see when you create a board.
The different columns within a board are referred to as "lists" and items within the list are "cards".
You will have the freedom to create/rename/delete the lists as you see fit, and to move cards between lists as they move through the to-do/doing/done phases that you define.

Now that we have that nomenclature out of the way, lets get started with our Trello accounts.

> ## Create a board with some dummy cards
> - Create a new workspace
> - Within that workspace create a new board
> - Within that board create three columns "todo", "doing", and "done"
> - Within the "todo" column create a new card
> - Set the title of the card to be something like "Create a card"
> - Move the card into the "doing" column
> - Add yourself as a member of the card
> - Add a short description to the card
> - Move the card to the "done" column
> 
> Pat yourself on the back for a job well done.

## Time management
Part of project management but different.

Prospective
- scoping of work
- planning effort
- day-to-day, hour-by-hour planning (calendar)
- avoiding over-commits

Retrospective
- tracking effort
- learning to better scope / plan work
- adjusting future plans


Exercise
- list the work that you do, how much time you want to spend on each item, and how much you *think* you do
- Of the three methods described for time tracking which would be more useful to you
- What are the pro/con of some of the methods


## Online tools for project/time management
Trello

Literally any calendar app

## Managing "up"
- Expectation management
- Giving deadlines
- Assigning todo items
- Having meeting agendas

Discussion about potential issues and solutions.
